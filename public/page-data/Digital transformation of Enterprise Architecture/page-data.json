Traditional enterprise architecture can't acclimate to the high dynamics of digitalization in this unique circumstance. Worldwide trends, such as collaborating, digital inclusion, ethical digital technologies, privacy and transparency, connected workflow, promoting employee entrepreneurship, digital identity and ecosystem business models, growing connectivity, mobility and state-of‐the-art analytics have propelled enterprises to move outside their traditional business models.</p>\n<p>In the advanced digital economy, where customers are also producers and have evolved into prosumers, businesses have been able to switch from products and services to digital experiences, in which\nprosumers can consume as well as produce on digital platforms.\nEnterprises are being urged to create digital ecosystems that comprises of\nmultiple applications and technologies. For instance, the digital health\necosystem consists of various entities, where improvements in the EA\nattributes are crucial for their viable usefulness. A DHE is comprised of\ncomponents such as robotics, cloud computing solutions, artificial\nintelligence, blockchain systems, learning platforms, cognitive analytics,\nsensors, the Internet of Medical Things or IoMT, enterprise applications, 5G\ntechnology, Data as a Platform or DaaP, and NLP and NLG.\nIn this sequence of EA attributes at the age of digital transformation, I\ndiscuss the trait of interoperability. Digital enterprises, as defined in the\ndigital health ecosystem, are comprised of an assortment of digital\ntechnologies as well as ground - breaking business solutions that\nnecessitate the coordination of various business functions, systems, data,\nand applications. Enterprises are inclining toward reusing their legacy\nsystems and combining them with front line systems in the light of the fact\nthat the theory of the Big Bang is anything but a cheap and easy alternative</p>\n<p>for them. Accordingly, they are leaning toward interoperability to improve\ntheir competitive advantage in a volatile market.\nThe first attribute of an enterprise architecture in the digital age is\ntransformative interoperability, which basically permits systems in a digital\necosystem to collaborate with one another to accomplish a common\nobjective. Data silos are dispensed with, and data integration is automated\nbecause of interoperability. It will assist businesses with opening concealed\npatterns just as give augmented intelligence to offer value-added services.\nService-oriented computing basically facilitates interoperability. It enables\nan ecosystem composed of cooperating services that are inexactly\nconnected to one another to produce agile applications that span across\nan enterprise and its platforms. Some of advantages of services-oriented\narchitecture include implementing end-to-end collaborative business\nprocesses and executing enterprise service coordination.\nAnother concept in this domain is iPaaS, or Integration-Platform as a\nService, which is a cloud-based solution that streamlines application\nintegration across on-premises and cloud environments. iPaaS offers\nsimplified, standardized ways to connect applications, data, processes, and\nservices with no compelling reason to acquire, install, handle, and support\nintegration hardware, middleware, and software. The primary distinction\nbetween iPaaS and ESB or Enterprise Service Bus technology is that while\nESB upholds SOA, it does not fulfill the digital transformation prerequisites\nof new businesses. As indicated by IBM, the key clarification is the ESB's\nlack of agility and its highly centralized approach. Furthermore, existing\napplication development methods utilize micro-services and containers to\ncreate apps in a more granular manner, and iPaaS as a container-based\napproach will enable enterprises to divide their ESP into smaller pieces\ntrying to optimize agility, scalability, and resilience; which are some of the\nother attributes of EA in the age of digital transformation</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Digital transformation of Enterprise Architecture","date":"May 02, 2021","description":null,"author":"Dr. Tahereh Saheb"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/ANALYTICS CONSULTING & STATISTICAL COMPUTING/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ANALYTICS CONSULTING & STATISTICAL COMPUTING"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Present’s condition of Banks and NBFCs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Present’s condition of Banks and NBFCs"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"88cfe0b7-6925-51f8-85ce-23a952df1115","previousPostId":"9f9b9a64-9b08-5dfa-8bff-c6e151734fd4","nextPostId":"c702a99e-3ec7-5dcc-be75-06c2c12b43c5"}},
