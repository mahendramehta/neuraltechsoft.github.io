Interoperability, Service-oriented Computing and iPaaS technology:
Digital transformation has created a world that is overwhelmed by
unsteadiness, vulnerability, and intricacy. Traditional enterprise architecture can&#39;t acclimate to the high dynamics of digitalization in this unique circumstance. Worldwide trends, such as collaborating, digital inclusion, ethical digital technologies, privacy and transparency, connected workflow, promoting employee entrepreneurship, digital identity and ecosystem business models, growing connectivity, mobility and state-of‚Äêthe-art analytics have propelled enterprises to move outside their traditional business models. 

In the advanced digital economy, where customers are also producers and have evolved into prosumers, businesses have been able to switch from products and services to digital experiences, in which
prosumers can consume as well as produce on digital platforms.
Enterprises are being urged to create digital ecosystems that comprises of
multiple applications and technologies. For instance, the digital health
ecosystem consists of various entities, where improvements in the EA
attributes are crucial for their viable usefulness. A DHE is comprised of
components such as robotics, cloud computing solutions, artificial
intelligence, blockchain systems, learning platforms, cognitive analytics,
sensors, the Internet of Medical Things or IoMT, enterprise applications, 5G
technology, Data as a Platform or DaaP, and NLP and NLG.
In this sequence of EA attributes at the age of digital transformation, I
discuss the trait of interoperability. Digital enterprises, as defined in the
digital health ecosystem, are comprised of an assortment of digital
technologies as well as ground - breaking business solutions that
necessitate the coordination of various business functions, systems, data,
and applications. Enterprises are inclining toward reusing their legacy
systems and combining them with front line systems in the light of the fact
that the theory of the Big Bang is anything but a cheap and easy alternative

for them. Accordingly, they are leaning toward interoperability to improve
their competitive advantage in a volatile market.
The first attribute of an enterprise architecture in the digital age is
transformative interoperability, which basically permits systems in a digital
ecosystem to collaborate with one another to accomplish a common
objective. Data silos are dispensed with, and data integration is automated
because of interoperability. It will assist businesses with opening concealed
patterns just as give augmented intelligence to offer value-added services.
Service-oriented computing basically facilitates interoperability. It enables
an ecosystem composed of cooperating services that are inexactly
connected to one another to produce agile applications that span across
an enterprise and its platforms. Some of advantages of services-oriented
architecture include implementing end-to-end collaborative business
processes and executing enterprise service coordination.
Another concept in this domain is iPaaS, or Integration-Platform as a
Service, which is a cloud-based solution that streamlines application
integration across on-premises and cloud environments. iPaaS offers
simplified, standardized ways to connect applications, data, processes, and
services with no compelling reason to acquire, install, handle, and support
integration hardware, middleware, and software. The primary distinction
between iPaaS and ESB or Enterprise Service Bus technology is that while
ESB upholds SOA, it does not fulfill the digital transformation prerequisites
of new businesses. As indicated by IBM, the key clarification is the ESB&#39;s
lack of agility and its highly centralized approach. Furthermore, existing
application development methods utilize micro-services and containers to
create apps in a more granular manner, and iPaaS as a container-based
approach will enable enterprises to divide their ESP into smaller pieces
trying to optimize agility, scalability, and resilience; which are some of the
other attributes of EA in the age of digital transformation
